# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I wanted to make a webpage that helps fellow students have notes on the Prework studies.
I built this project to learn basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.
It helped me get started with the basics of coding and will help others as well.
I learned the basic structures of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Git, README and Deployment.
